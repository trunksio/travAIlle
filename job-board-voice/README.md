4. **AI Assistance**: The voice assistant helps with:
   - Key skills and experience relevant to the role
   - Personal statement about why they're a good fit
5. **Real-time Updates**: Watch the form populate as you speak
6. **Submit Application**: Review and submit when ready

## Development

### Local Backend Development

```bash
cd backend
pip install fastapi uvicorn redis websockets
python main.py
```

### Local MCP Server Development

```bash
cd mcp-server
pip install fastmcp mcp redis pydantic
python internal_mobility_server.py
```

### Frontend Development

```bash
cd frontend
python -m http.server 5011
# Visit http://localhost:5011
```

## Monitoring

### View Service Logs

```bash
# All services
docker-compose logs -f

# Specific service
docker-compose logs -f backend
docker-compose logs -f mcp-server
docker-compose logs -f frontend
```

### Check Service Health

```bash
# View running services
docker-compose ps

# Test backend API
curl http://localhost:5010/api/jobs

# Check MCP server
curl http://localhost:5012/
```

## Troubleshooting

### Voice Assistant Not Appearing
- Verify Elevenlabs agent ID in `.env`
- Check browser console for errors
- Ensure agent is configured with MCP tools

### Form Not Updating
- Check WebSocket connection in browser console
- Verify MCP server is running
- Review MCP server logs for tool execution

### Application Not Submitting
- Ensure all required fields are filled
- Check backend logs for errors
- Verify Redis connection

## Production Deployment

### Reverse Proxy Configuration

The application can be deployed behind a reverse proxy (Apache2 or Nginx) for production use. Example configuration files are provided:

#### Apache2
```bash
# Enable required modules
sudo a2enmod proxy proxy_http proxy_wstunnel headers rewrite

# Copy and enable configuration
sudo cp apache2-proxy.conf /etc/apache2/sites-available/job-portal.conf
sudo a2ensite job-portal
sudo systemctl reload apache2
```

Access the portal at: `http://your-domain.com/job-portal`

#### Nginx
```bash
# Copy configuration
sudo cp nginx-proxy.conf /etc/nginx/sites-available/job-portal
sudo ln -s /etc/nginx/sites-available/job-portal /etc/nginx/sites-enabled/

# Test and reload
sudo nginx -t
sudo systemctl reload nginx
```

Both configurations support:
- Path-based routing (`/job-portal`)
- WebSocket connections for real-time updates
- Server-Sent Events (SSE) for MCP communication
- Static asset caching
- Security headers
- HTTPS/SSL setup (commented examples included)

## Security Considerations

- `.env` file is gitignored to protect credentials
- Use HTTPS in production environments
- Implement authentication for production
- Add rate limiting for API endpoints
- Validate all user inputs
- Configure proper CORS headers when using reverse proxy
- Use firewall rules to restrict direct Docker port access

## Support

For issues or questions:
1. Check service logs with `docker-compose logs`
2. Verify all services are running with `docker-compose ps`
3. Review browser console for client-side errors
